# Signals and Systems

// TODO: **Explain about signals** 

Signal is a function of independent variables that carry **information**. Those information could be a person's voice, the input voltage of a RLC circuit, stock price of a given period of time, a digital image, etc.

Signals can be classified as continuous, discrete, periodic, etc.

// TODO: **Explain about systems**

Systems can be explained as a mathematical model that can correlates a given input with an output. That is, it's possible to process an input signal and generate a new signal. That

For example, an electrical signal can be used as input of a robot system so it can rotate, generating torque as the output signal.

Systems can be classified as linear, time invariant, causal, etc.
